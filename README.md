# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles for my CLI setup. 

## Vim

I use nvim with powerline. Use the `powerline.yaml` file to create a conda
environment.

## Starship Prompt
`cargo install starship`, use `starship.toml`.

## Zoxide for easier terminal navigation

`cargo install zoxide`. This is a Rust-version of `z`, the old script you
could use to jump around directories you've already `cd`ed to using regex
patterns.

## Fish Shell

Copy the `fish` directory to `~/.config`

## Fonts

These are the fonts you need to get things working. You *don't* need to install
all of them. Pick and choose, the download is about 16GB.

## zsh

I don't use zsh anymore, but I've still included this here.
